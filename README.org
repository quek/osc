#+title: Open Sound Control

This is a lisp implementation of the Open Sound Control protocol (or more accurately  ‚Äúdata transport specification‚Äù or ‚Äúencoding‚Äù). The code should be close to ANSI standard common lisp and provides self contained code for encoding and decoding of OSC data, messages, and bundles. Since OSC describes a transport independent encoding (and does not specify a transport layer) messages can be send using TCP,  UDP or other network protocols (e.g. [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2549][RFC 2549]]). It seems UDP is more common amongst  programmes that communicate using OSC and. the =osc-examples.lisp= file contains a few simple examples of how to send and receive OSC via UDP. The examples are reasonably compatible with the packets send from/to max-msp, pd, supercollider and liblo. more details about OSC can be found at https://OpenSoundControl.org

** OSC 1.0 and 1.1 support

This implementation supports the [[https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/spec-1_0.html][OpenSoundControl Specification 1.0]] and the required typetags listed in the [[https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/spec-1_1.html][OpenSoundControl Specification 1.1]] (as described in an [[https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/files/2009-NIME-OSC-1.1.pdf][NIME 2009 paper]]). Some optional types are supported.
